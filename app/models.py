from typing import Optional 
# This imports the Optional type hint from Python‚Äôs typing module. It‚Äôs used to indicate that a variable can either hold a specific type (e.g., str) or be None. In this case, it‚Äôs used for the password_hash field, which might be None if a user hasn‚Äôt set a password yet (though rare in practice).
import sqlalchemy as sa
# SQLAlchemy is a Python library for working with databases, allowing you to define tables, query data, and manage database connections. Here, it‚Äôs used to specify column types (e.g., sa.String).
import sqlalchemy.orm as so 
#Imports SQLAlchemy‚Äôs Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) module, aliased as so. The ORM lets you define database tables as Python classes (models) and interact with the database using Python objects instead of raw SQL queries. It‚Äôs used here for defining the User model and mapping its attributes to database columns.
from app import db
# Imports the db object from your Flask app‚Äôs app/__init__.py. This db is an instance of Flask-SQLAlchemy, a Flask extension that simplifies SQLAlchemy integration with Flask. It‚Äôs configured to connect to your database (e.g., SQLite via sqlite:///app.db) and is used to define models and interact with the database.
from datetime import datetime,timezone


# This class defines the structure of the user table, including its columns (fields) and their properties. It allows you to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) user records in the database using Python code.
class User(db.Model):
    # Why is a constructor not needed here ? 
    # When you do this:

    # user = User(username="suraj", email="suraj@example.com")
    # Even though you didn‚Äôt write an __init__ method, it still works because:

    # ‚úÖ SQLAlchemy's db.Model base class generates the constructor automatically, using the columns you defined.

    # üîß Under the Hood:
    # When you inherit from db.Model, SQLAlchemy:

    # Inspects your class attributes (like username, email, etc.)

    # Generates a constructor that accepts them as keyword arguments

    # Automatically maps those arguments to table columns

    # So this works out of the box:

    #As you are inheriting from the base class db.model,this makes the class User, a database model, meaning it represents a table in your database (named user by default, based on the class name).
    # Each instance of this class will correspond to a row in the user table.
    id: so.Mapped[int] = so.mapped_column(primary_key = True)
    # id: so.Mapped[int]: Uses SQLAlchemy‚Äôs ORM type hinting to indicate that the id attribute maps to an integer column in the database. The so.Mapped annotation helps tools like linters understand the type of data this column holds.so.Mapped[int] or so.Mapped[str] define the type of the column, and also make values required, or non-nullable in database terms.

    # so.mapped_column(primary_key=True): Defines the id column as the primary key for the user table. A primary key is a unique identifier for each row (user) in the table. By default, SQLAlchemy will auto-increment this value (e.g., 1, 2, 3, ...) for each new user.

    username: so.Mapped[str] = so.mapped_column(sa.String(64), index = True, unique = True)

    # username: so.Mapped[str]: Specifies that the username attribute maps to a string  column in the database.
    # so.mapped_column(sa.String(64), index=True, unique=True):
    # sa.String(64): Defines the column type as a string with a maximum length of 64   characters.
    # index=True: Creates a database index for this column, which speeds up queries (e.g.,searching for a user by username).
    # unique=True: Ensures that each username in the user table is unique, preventing  duplicate usernames.

# Purpose: Stores the user‚Äôs username, which must be unique (e.g., no two users can have the username ‚Äúsuraj‚Äù). The index improves performance for username-based queries.

    email: so.Mapped[str] = so.mapped_column(sa.String(64), index = True, unique=True)
    password_hash : so.Mapped[Optional[str]] = so.mapped_column(sa.String(256))
    #  defines that The column can be nullable in database terms.
    posts : so.WriteOnlyMapped['Post'] = so.relationship(back_populates='author')
    def __repr__(self):
        return '<User {}>'.format(self.username)
    # Purpose: Provides a human-readable representation of a User object when printed or inspected, making it easier to debug or test your code.

class Post(db.Model):
    id: so.Mapped[int] = so.mapped_column(primary_key = True)
    body: so.Mapped[str] = so.mapped_column(sa.String(140))
    timestamp: so.Mapped[datetime] = so.mapped_column(
        index= True, default=lambda : datetime.now(timezone.utc))
    
    # SQLAlchemy's mapped_column (or Column) has a default parameter, which tells it:
    # ‚ÄúIf I don‚Äôt specify a value for this column when inserting a new row, use this default.‚Äù
    # You can give default as return datetime.now(timezone.utc) to return the current time in utc.

    user_id : so.Mapped[int] = so.mapped_column(sa.ForeignKey(User.id),index=True)
    author: so.Mapped[User] = so.relationship(back_populates = 'posts')

    # author: so.Mapped[User]: Declares a virtual field called author that maps to a User object. This isn‚Äôt a column in the post table but a Python-level relationship that SQLAlchemy creates for convenience.
    # so.relationship(back_populates='posts'):
    # so.relationship: Sets up a high level relationship between the Post and User models. It allows you to access the User object associated with a post via post.author (e.g., post.author.username to get the author‚Äôs username).
    # back_populates='posts': Specifies that this relationship is bidirectional. The User model must have a corresponding posts field (e.g., posts: so.Mapped[List[Post]] = so.relationship(back_populates='author')) that lets you access all posts by a user via user.posts. This links the two sides of the relationship.
    # Purpose: Simplifies querying related data. Instead of manually querying the User table with user_id, you can directly access the author‚Äôs details (e.g., post.author.email).

    def __repr__(self):
        return '<Post {}>'.format(self.body)
